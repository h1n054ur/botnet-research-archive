## Project Overview

The **Botnet Research Archive** is an educational documentation project that provides structured, academic analysis of historical botnet source code from the mid-2000s era (approximately 2002–2009). The project catalogues, classifies, and analyzes approximately 250 unique malware specimens drawn from the publicly archived [maestron/botnets](https://github.com/maestron/botnets) repository on GitHub.

This documentation site transforms raw source code into a structured educational resource by:

- **Cataloguing** all specimens with consistent metadata (family, language, capabilities, era)
- **Classifying** specimens by family lineage, showing evolutionary relationships
- **Mapping** observed techniques to the [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework
- **Contextualizing** each specimen within the broader history of cybersecurity threats
- **Extracting** defensive lessons applicable to modern security practice

<Aside type="danger" title="Academic Disclaimer">

**This project is strictly educational.** It exists to support university-level coursework in cybersecurity, malware analysis, digital forensics, and computer science.

- **No malicious intent.** This documentation is created solely for academic study and defensive security research.
- **No binaries are hosted or distributed.** This site contains only analysis, commentary, and documentation - not executable code.
- **No execution was performed.** All analysis is based on static source-level review. No malware was compiled, executed, or deployed at any stage of this project.
- **No encouragement of illegal activity.** The techniques described here are documented to help defenders understand threats, not to enable attacks.
- **Historical specimens only.** All analyzed code dates from 2002–2009. The vulnerabilities exploited (DCOM, LSASS, ASN.1, etc.) were patched over 15 years ago.

This project follows the same academic principles as university courses that study historical malware (e.g., Carnegie Mellon's "Malware Analysis" course, Georgia Tech's "Malware Analysis and Defense," and similar programs worldwide).

## Methodology

### Approach: Source-Level Static Analysis

All analysis in this project was conducted through **source-level static analysis** - reading and interpreting source code without compilation or execution. This approach:

1. **Eliminates risk** - no malware is ever run
2. **Provides deeper insight** - source code reveals intent and implementation details that binary analysis often cannot
3. **Enables educational transparency** - every observation can be verified by examining the cited source files

### Analysis Process

Each specimen was analyzed through the following steps:

1. **Identification** - Determine family membership, version, author attribution (from comments/headers), and compilation requirements
2. **Capability Mapping** - Enumerate all functional modules (C&C, spreading, DDoS, stealing, persistence, evasion)
3. **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping** - Map each identified capability to the corresponding ATT&CK technique ID
4. **CVE Identification** - Identify any exploited vulnerabilities by matching exploit code against known CVE entries
5. **Lineage Analysis** - Determine derivation relationships between specimens through code comparison, author comments, and changelog analysis
6. **Defensive Extraction** - Identify detection signatures, behavioral indicators, and defensive countermeasures

### What This Project Does NOT Do

- **No dynamic analysis** - No specimens were executed in sandboxes, VMs, or any other environment
- **No network testing** - No exploit code was tested against live or simulated targets
- **No binary production** - No source code was compiled into executable form
- **No vulnerability research** - No new vulnerabilities were discovered or disclosed
- **No tool development** - No offensive tools were created based on the analyzed code

## How to Use This Resource

### For Students

This archive is designed to supplement university coursework in:

- **Malware Analysis** - Study real-world malware architecture, code structure, and implementation patterns
- **Network Security** - Understand botnet C&C protocols (IRC, HTTP, P2P), DDoS techniques, and network-based detection methods
- **Operating Systems** - Examine how malware interacts with the Windows API, process management, registry, and file system
- **Software Engineering** - Observe how open-source collaboration dynamics played out in the malware ecosystem (forking, modular architecture, version control patterns)
- **Digital Forensics** - Learn what artifacts these specimens create (registry keys, mutexes, file paths, network signatures)

**Suggested study path:**
1. Start with the [Evolution Timeline](/botnet-research-archive/analysis/evolution-timeline) for historical context
2. Read the [rBot/rxBot Family](/botnet-research-archive/families/rbot-rxbot) page to understand the dominant codebase
3. Compare with [Zeus](/botnet-research-archive/families/zeus) to see the paradigm shift from IRC to HTTP C&C
4. Review the [MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](/botnet-research-archive/analysis/mitre-attack) to connect specimens to standardized technique taxonomy
5. Study the [Defensive Lessons](/botnet-research-archive/analysis/defensive-lessons) to understand the security implications

### For Researchers

- The [Complete Inventory](/botnet-research-archive/reference/inventory) provides a comprehensive specimen catalogue with links to original source code
- Family pages document evolutionary lineage and code derivation relationships
- The [Bibliography](/botnet-research-archive/reference/bibliography) provides entry points into the academic literature
- MITRE ATT&CK mappings enable integration with threat intelligence workflows

### For Educators

- The modular page structure allows assigning individual families or categories as course readings
- The [Glossary](/botnet-research-archive/reference/glossary) provides consistent terminology for classroom use
- The evolutionary lineage analysis (sdBot → rBot → rxBot) provides a compelling case study in software evolution
- The IRC-vs-HTTP C&C comparison offers a concrete example of architectural trade-offs
- The hydra-2008.1 specimen provides a documented IoT botnet precursor for discussions of emerging threats
