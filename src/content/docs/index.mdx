## // ARCHIVE_OVERVIEW

This project provides **comprehensive educational documentation** of a publicly available collection of historical botnet source code spanning **2002 to 2009**. All analysis is conducted for academic purposes with a focus on **defensive cybersecurity** and **MITRE ATT&CK mapping**.

:::caution[Educational Purposes Only]
This archive contains NO executable code. All source references link to the [original public repository](https://github.com/maestron/botnets). This documentation exists to help security researchers, students, and educators understand historical cyber threats for **defensive purposes only**.
