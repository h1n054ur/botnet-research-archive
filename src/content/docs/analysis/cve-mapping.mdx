## Introduction

One of the most educational aspects of this collection is the clear mapping between publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs and Microsoft Security Bulletins) and their weaponization in botnet source code. This page provides a comprehensive reference of every exploit identified across all specimen families.

## Master CVE Table - Bot Families

The following table documents all exploits found in the IRC bot families (sdBot, rBot, rxBot, NZM, 120-Series, and related variants), ordered chronologically by vulnerability disclosure date.

## Exploit Pack CVEs

The commercial exploit kits in the collection targeted **client-side** vulnerabilities (browsers, document readers, plugins) rather than network services.

| Kit | CVE | Target Software | Technique | Description |
|-----|-----|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Fiesta3** | CVE-2007-5659 | Adobe Reader | Heap spray via PDF JavaScript | `Collab​.collect​Email​Info` vulnerability; dynamically generated PDF with `/OpenAction` JS trigger |
| **IcePack** | Multiple (modular) | IE 6/7, Firefox, Opera | Browser fingerprinting + targeted exploit delivery | 12+ modular exploit files in `exploits/` directory; exact CVEs vary by module configuration |
| **Fragus** | Multiple (8 exploits) | Browser + plugins | Drive-by download framework | Affiliate-tracked exploitation; exact CVEs configured per deployment |
| **my_poly_sploit** | Multiple | Multi-browser | Polymorphic shellcode | Novel: shellcode mutations per delivery to defeat signatures |

<Aside type="caution">
Exploit kits were designed to be modular - operators could add or remove exploit modules based on available CVEs. The specific CVEs active in any deployment depended on the operator's configuration. The table above reflects what was found in the archived source code, not necessarily all CVEs these kits ever used.

## IoT / Embedded Device Exploits

| Specimen | CVE | Target | Attack Vector | Description |
|----------|-----|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **hydra-2008.1** | N/A (default credentials) | D-Link routers (MIPSEL) | Telnet brute-force (port 23) | Dictionary of default/common credentials |
| **hydra-2008.1** | N/A (info disclosure) | D-Link web interface | HTTP POST to admin panel (port 80) | Information disclosure vulnerability leaking admin password from HTML page |

<Aside type="note">
Hydra's attacks exploited **design weaknesses** (default credentials, information disclosure) rather than specific memory corruption CVEs. This pattern - targeting configuration errors rather than software bugs - became the dominant IoT attack vector, as later demonstrated by Mirai in 2016.
</Aside>

## Additional Service Exploits (Non-CVE)

Several bot families included brute-force and exploitation modules targeting services without specific CVE associations:

| Module | Target | Port | Method | Families |
|--------|--------|------|--------|----------|
| **NetBIOS brute** | Windows file shares | 139, 445/TCP | ~80+ password dictionary | sdBot, SpyBot, rBot, rxBot, all derivatives |
| **VNC brute** | VNC remote desktop | 5900/TCP | Password brute-force | 120-Series |
| **MySQL brute + UDF** | MySQL databases | 3306/TCP | Credential brute-force → UDF injection for code execution | 120-Series |
| **MSSQL brute** | Microsoft SQL Server | 1433/TCP | SA password brute-force | rBot, rxBot, 120-Series |
| **FTP brute** | FTP servers | 21/TCP | Credential brute-force | Multiple |
| **Cisco scanner** | Cisco routers | Various | SNMP/Telnet probing | 120-Series, hdbotv0.2 |
| **RFI scanner** | PHP web applications | 80/TCP | Google dork-based remote file inclusion scanning | RFI scanner tool (Perl) |

## Exploit Integration Lag Analysis

One of the most valuable insights from this collection is the measurable **time between public vulnerability disclosure and weaponization** in botnet code.

### Lag Time by Era

| Era | Typical Lag | Example | Evidence |
|-----|-------------|---------|----------|
| **2001–2002 CVEs** | 1–2 years | UPnP (CVE-2001-0876): disclosed Dec 2001, integrated ~2004 | Older vulns added retroactively when rBot codebase matured |
| **2003 CVEs (early)** | 6–12 months | WebDAV (CVE-2003-0109): disclosed Mar 2003, integrated Mar 2004 | Still significant delay for initial waves |
| **2003 CVEs (late)** | 3–6 months | DameWare (CVE-2003-1030): disclosed Dec 2003, integrated Apr 2004 | Lag shortening as exploit sharing improves |
| **2004 CVEs** | **Days to weeks** | LSASS (CVE-2003-0533, MS04-011): disclosed Apr 2004, integrated Apr 2004 | rx_dev changelog shows near-simultaneous integration |
| **2005 CVEs** | **Days to weeks** | PnP (CVE-2005-1983, MS05-039): disclosed Aug 2005, weaponized immediately | Zotob worm used this within days |
| **2006 CVEs** | Weeks to months | NetAPI (CVE-2006-3439): integrated in 120-Series 2006–2007 | Continued rapid adoption |

### Key Observations

1. **Lag decreased dramatically** from years (2001 CVEs) to days (2004–2005 CVEs) as the malware ecosystem matured
2. **Cross-pollination accelerated integration** - the DCOM exploit was shared from Agobot to rBot, documented in source comments
3. **Standardized exploit frameworks** (rBot's `EXPLOIT` structure array in `advscan.cpp`) made adding new exploits a matter of filling in a single array entry
4. **Patch Tuesday became weaponization day** - by 2005, bot authors were monitoring Microsoft Security Bulletins and integrating exploits before many organizations could deploy patches

## Exploit Categories by Attack Surface

### Network Service Exploits (Server-Side)

These exploits target running services on remote machines, enabling worm-like self-propagation:

| Attack Surface | CVEs in Collection | Primary Families |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **RPC/DCOM** (port 135) | CVE-2003-0352, CVE-2003-0715 | rBot, rxBot, sdBot, Phatbot |
| **SMB/CIFS** (port 445) | CVE-2003-0533, CVE-2003-0812, CVE-2003-0818, CVE-2005-1983, CVE-2006-3439 | All major families |
| **IIS Web Server** (port 80/443) | CVE-2003-0109, CVE-2003-0719 | rBot, rxBot |
| **SQL Server** (port 1433) | CVE-2002-1123 | rBot, rxBot, 120-Series |
| **UPnP** (port 5000) | CVE-2001-0876 | rBot, rxBot |
| **Third-party software** | CVE-2003-1030 (DameWare), CVE-2006-2630 (Symantec) | rxBot, Urxbot, 120-Series |

### Client-Side Exploits (Browser/Document)

These exploits target end-user applications, delivered via drive-by download:

| Attack Surface | CVEs in Collection | Delivery Kit |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Adobe Reader** (PDF) | CVE-2007-5659 | Fiesta3 |
| **Internet Explorer** | Multiple (modular) | IcePack, Fragus |
| **Firefox** | Multiple (modular) | IcePack |
| **Flash Player** (SWF) | Multiple | Fiesta3, my_poly_sploit |
| **Java Runtime** | Multiple (modular) | Fragus, IcePack |

### Credential/Configuration Exploits

These target weak or default credentials rather than software vulnerabilities:

| Attack Surface | Method | Primary Specimens |
|----------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Windows shares** (NetBIOS) | Password dictionary (~80+ entries) | Nearly all IRC bots |
| **Telnet** (embedded devices) | Default credential lists | hydra-2008.1 |
| **VNC** | Password brute-force | 120-Series |
| **MySQL** | Root/weak password brute-force | 120-Series |
| **FTP** | Credential brute-force | Multiple |
| **MSSQL** | SA password brute-force | rBot, 120-Series |

---

## Defensive Context

### Patch Management Implications

The lag analysis above provides a clear lesson: **the window between disclosure and weaponization shrank from years to days**. By 2005, organizations that did not patch within the first week of a Microsoft Security Bulletin release were at significant risk of automated exploitation.

### Vulnerability Prioritization

The exploits most widely adopted across bot families share common characteristics:

1. **Remote, pre-authentication** - No user interaction required
2. **Common service** - Target runs on most Windows installations (RPC, SMB, Workstation Service)
3. **Reliable exploitation** - Buffer overflows with consistent offsets across OS versions
4. **Wormable** - Exploit provides code execution, enabling autonomous propagation

These same prioritization criteria remain relevant for modern vulnerability management programs.
